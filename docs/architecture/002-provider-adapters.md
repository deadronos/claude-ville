# ADR 002: Normalized multi-provider adapter contract

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Provider CLIs store session history in different file formats and directory layouts.

Without a normalized adapter contract, every new provider would duplicate parsing logic and UI code would need provider-specific branches everywhere.

## Decision

Keep a dedicated adapter per provider under `claudeville/adapters/` and require each adapter to provide the same core behavior:

- detect whether the provider is installed / available
- enumerate active sessions
- resolve a single session’s detail view
- expose watch paths for live updates

The registry in `claudeville/adapters/index.ts` remains the aggregator that merges adapter output into the shared session model.

The current registry wires these adapters:

- `claude.ts`
- `codex.ts`
- `gemini.ts`
- `openclaw.ts`
- `copilot.ts`
- `vscode.ts`
- `pi.ts`
- `opencode.ts`
- `hermes.ts`

The registry is also responsible for sanitizing summaries and details, normalizing token data, and attaching `estimatedCost` before data leaves the adapter layer.

## Consequences

- New providers can be added without changing the rendering pipeline.
- Session data is normalized before it reaches application services.
- Adapter implementations remain file-format-specific, which keeps provider logic isolated.
- Some parsing logic is duplicated today and should be kept under review for future refactors.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
    - **Caching**: Heavy adapters like `gemini.ts` use an LRU-style cache for project path restoration to avoid expensive recursive scans.
    - **Scoped Reading**: Large logs in `vscode.ts` are checked for activity using partial reads (`readLines` with `count`) instead of loading entire files.
- Adapter I/O operations must be non-blocking. Prefer `fs.promises` over synchronous `fs` methods, and use `Promise.all` for concurrent operations. Blocking the event loop degrades the responsiveness of all providers scanned together in `getAllSessions`.

## Compliance

Every adapter method that performs file or network I/O must be implemented as an `async` function using non-blocking primitives. Specific requirements:

- **File I/O**: Use `fs.promises` instead of `fs.readFileSync`, `fs.readdirSync`, or `fs.statSync`.
- **Concurrent scans**: When iterating over multiple directories or files, use `Promise.all` to run operations in parallel rather than sequential `for` loops.
- **Detail fetching**: When a session scan must fetch detail data per-session, fan out with `Promise.all` — do not fetch sequentially.
- **Availability checks**: `isAvailable()` may use synchronous `fs.existsSync` as a one-time check; all other I/O must be async.

The `getAllSessions` function in `adapters/index.ts` calls all adapters concurrently. If any adapter blocks on synchronous I/O, it blocks the entire scan for all providers.
